# C++ Sorting/Math
This is a project which has created headers to make sorting and maths in C++ easier.

C++ Sorting/Math is used for making sorting and maths easier in programming,
and includes a set of functions to use in the file cppmath.h
Remember to reference it with:

`#include "cppmath.h"`

or wherever you have stored the file,
e.g. `#include "C:\Documents\Headers\cppmath.h"`

Note: Also, remember to put cppmath.h and sort.h or the sorting functions will not work.
